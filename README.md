# Event / Day Planner

GIVEN the user wants to use a daily planner to create a schedule
Once the planner is launched from the link, the current date is displayed at the top of the screen.

The day planner is divided into timeblocks of the regular working day schedule, with different colors indicating what hours have passed, the current hour, and the hours yet to come.

Each timeblock is given a textblock that is interactive and can hold and store data onto local storage enabling the planner to stay the same even if the user refreshes the page.

This is done with the the interactive save button on the right side of the timeblock, used to save any text to the timeblock before refreshing the page.
